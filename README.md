## Introduction
This project utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to detect faces in images and videos. The face detection model is trained using deep learning algorithms and can accurately identify and locate faces in various conditions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Dataset
The model is trained on [insert dataset name or link], which contains images of faces in various environments and lighting conditions. The dataset includes labeled images for training and testing the model.

### Dataset Overview:
- Number of images: [2]
- Image formats: [e.g., JPEG, PNG]
- License: [insert license information]

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection.git
   cd face-detection
Usage
Running the Model:

To detect faces in a single image:

bash
Copy code
python detect_faces.py --image path/to/image.jpg
To detect faces in a video:

bash
Copy code
python detect_faces.py --video path/to/video.mp4
Results:

The detected faces will be highlighted in the output image or video. You can adjust parameters like the detection threshold or model used in the detect_faces.py script.
Results
Include sample output images or videos showing the detected faces. You can add metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall if applicable. Visualizations of model performance can also be included.

Conclusion
The face detection model successfully identifies and locates faces with a high degree of accuracy. Future enhancements may include:

Improving detection under various lighting conditions.
Adding features for facial recognition or emotion detection.
